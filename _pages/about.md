I develop mathematical tools for data assimilation in earth system modeling and other nonlinear problems. I am interested in uncertainty quantification, data assimilation methodologies, and multiscale stochastic modeling applied to earth sciences and other geophysical systems. 

I am currently a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and NOAA's Physical Sciences Lab (NOAA PSL). My current research is focused on coupled data assimilation. I am developing guidance on how to model cross-fluid correlations in a strongly coupled atmosphere-ocean system, where observations of the atmosphere are allowed to update the ocean and vice versa. I am also working to assimilate SMAP observations of soil moisture into NOAA’s coupled land-atmosphere system. 

Prior to joining CIRES/NOAA PSL, I obtained my PhD at the University of Colorado, Boulder where I worked with Drs. Ian Grooms and Will Kleiber. In my graduate work I proposed a new multiscale localization method and applied it to a toy model with two coupled components. I also laid the theoretical groundwork for a stochastic seawater equation of state which is now implemented in NOAA’s MOM6 ocean model.
